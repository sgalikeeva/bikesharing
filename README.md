## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Data from New York City's bike-sharing program is used to extrapolate data to use in the analysis for Des Moines. 

## Results
There are seven visualizations in the dashboard. 

1. Gender Breakdown (https://public.tableau.com/views/challenge_16479984916240/BikeSharinginNYC?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This pie chart shows the breakdown of users by gender - male, female and unknown. Males use the bikesharing service the most as seen on the chart as it has the biggest piece of the pie with appoximately 1.5 million male users. Females users at a little over .5 million with unknown making up the rest of the pie with .2 million users. 

2. Peak Hours in August (https://public.tableau.com/shared/H9RXY7YPY?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This horizontal bar charts shows the times the bikes are used the most. 8-10am and 5-7pm are the most popular times to use the bike-sharing program.

3. Checkout Times for Users (https://public.tableau.com/shared/ZYN26B2FF?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This line chart shows how long bikes are checked out for all users. Between 1 and 20 minutes is the most popular amount of time, then the usage time sharply drops off.  

4. Checkout Times by Gender (https://public.tableau.com/shared/MPZ655TMD?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This line chart shows how long bikes are checked out by genders. Again between 1 and 20 minutes is the most popular amount of time, then the usage time sharply drops off, but with this chart the male line stands out just because there are more male users.  

5. Trips by Weekday (https://public.tableau.com/shared/PP8RZDJC7?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This heatmap shows how many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all users. As expected, during the week, the most popular times are 6-10am and 5-7pm which is due to commuting to and from work. And during the weekend, the most popular times are throughout the day from 10am-6pm. 

6. Trips by Gender (https://public.tableau.com/shared/Y7P6T2DYT?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

These three heatmaps show how many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week by gender. It is still very similar to the all user trip heatmap, with popular times during the week being during the commuting hours and through out the day during the weekend. 

7. Trips by Usertype and Gender (https://public.tableau.com/shared/64432N68H?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

This heatmap shows a  breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender. The type of users are customer and subscriber. Subscribers are annual subscribers of the bike-sharing service, while customers are short-term, one-off riders. From this viz, subscribers use the bike-sharing service constantly every day of the week, whereas customers are more likely to use the service on weekends. 

## Summary

From the results, a few points can be extrapolated to apply the New York bike-sharing data to a potential Des Moines bike-sharing service. Out of the users, there will be more males than females. Annual subscribers will use the service more often than a one-off customer. Commuting hours will be the most popular times of day that the service will be used.

Two additional visualizations that can be performed with the given dataset are whether age correlates to what kind of usertype a rider is and trip duration by gender and age and how it compares.
